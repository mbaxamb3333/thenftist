<p class="pargarph">
The project started because of the biggest problem of this space. We (the team) were buying and selling NFTâ€™s since the inception of ERC-721 and we noticed that we were all searching information using Google. Well, Google is a search engine, not an authority of the NFT space, and we see this as a major problem as search engines can also provide us all with crap information and non-curated content but most important it takes us too much time until we do the research and identify great NFT projects in which we can trust or invest. Apart of that, if you are an NFT creator,
    you must understand what makes the difference between a quality NFT and a bad one.
